# Critical Machine Learning

This list contains selected readings and resources that might be helpful in understanding basic ideas around machine learning/AI and thinking critically about what this all means. It contains items I have read or plan to; the list will be updated/modified occasionally. Some of the items will be grouped into subcollections that explore specific topics, such as:
* black box: <https://www.are.na/critical-machine-learning/black-boxes>

This collection is partly aimed at non-CS people like me, who are interested in the topic and will benefit from materials that use lots of plain language. Also, it could be useful to people who are within and/or much more comfortable with CS, and want to know what different people with various perspectives have to say about the technology. So some of this will be very basic both technically and in terms of its critical discussion, and hopefully that is a good thing.

## Primers

**Daly, Liza. "AI Literacy: The basics of machine learning," *World Writable*, Apr 11, 2017.**
<https://worldwritable.com/ai-literacy-the-basics-of-machine-learning-2e20f93e34b4>  
Daly provides a nice short introduction to the terms artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. Good accompaniment to the following videos.

Along with the previous post, I think it serves as a good lead into the following three longer reads.

This essay explains a non-ML approach that used hard-defined rules to determine what the user wrote. In contrast, the following two links (note: quite heavy on the browser) show machine learning-based approaches at a similar task:

## Machine learning as reproducer of existing norms and injustice
In what case ML / AI serves to reinforce existing norms, prejudices, injustice, and such? How does that happen and what can we do about it?

Some tweets I ran into:  
"a cool thing to remember is that whenever someone says 'A.I.' what they're really talking about is 'a computer program someone wrote'"

"tech that helps us CONFORM" (referring to Google Autodraw)

## Other items

**Seeing Theory by Daniel Kunin**
<http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory>  
Not precisely ML-related but nicely visualizes some basic statistical concepts.

## Other lists 

ML/AI-related things are pouring out in a ridiculous speed, reflecting the rapid growth of the field both as industry and research. Accordingly, people have built lists, daily digests, aggregators and other projects in order to collect and filter information. Someone is probably building a meta-list of these collections right now, if they haven't done so yet, and that it will not be long until that meta-list itself is outdated. It amuses me how a crucial piece of machine learning is dealing with large data, but I am hardly able to deal with the amount of machine learning-related information.

Anyway, this list points to other collections that I find relevant or complementary to the cml list, that inspired me, that I mean to take a closer look, etc.
